# AnyLisa (WIP)
AnyLisa is a tool you can use to launch a process as a service with any name, or launch a program hidden but not as a servicec. It is developed to detect if Taskmgr is open, if it is, it will terminate the hidden program. If closed, it will reopen it. AnyLisa uses a discord webhook to catch errors, those gets sent to me for better understanding what causes the bug/error.
